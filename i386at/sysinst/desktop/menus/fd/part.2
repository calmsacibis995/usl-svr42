You may use a partition of your secondary hard disk for the UNIX System.
If you choose to use a partition of your secondary hard disk, you will be
shown a screen that will allow you to partition your secondary hard disk.

WARNING:  All files in any partition(s) you delete will be destroyed.

`if [ "${SIZE_WARN}" = "No" ] ; then echo "If you choose to create a UNIX System partition on your secondary hard disk, \c"; fi`
`if [ "${SIZE_WARN}" = "No" ] ; then echo "it must be at least 40 MBs. \c"; fi`
`if [ "${SIZE_WARN}" = "Yes" ] ; then echo "The current partitioning is unacceptable for one of the following reasons: \c"; fi`
`if [ "${SIZE_WARN}" = "Yes" ] ; then echo " \c"; fi`
`if [ "${SIZE_WARN}" = "Yes" ] ; then echo "  o  There is no UNIX System partition \c"; fi`
`if [ "${SIZE_WARN}" = "Yes" ] ; then echo "  o  The UNIX System partition is not \"Active\" \c"; fi`
`if [ "${SIZE_WARN}" = "Yes" ] ; then echo "  o  The UNIX System partition is less than 40 MBs \c"; fi`

Your options are:

# Delimiter for form - the contents of this section are the same as
# the contents of a file specified w/-f options, autodetects whether its
# a form or a menu.
.form
Do not use a partition of the secondary hard disk for the UNIX System.
Use a partition of the secondary hard disk for the UNIX System.

# This is the prompt string for a MENU only.
.selection
Press '1' or '2' followed by 'ENTER':
#
# This is the text for beneath the menu (used to be -i strings)  Now we
# can include text underneath the menu selection line, because of .selection
#
# Help text.  This can also be done using I/O redirection; if aline begins
# with a <, the rest of the line is considered to be a filename and is
# read in as though it were part of the file.  If the file contains other
# .keywords, or `backticks` or <redirection, these will not be processed.
.help
For detailed instructions, press the 'F1' (or '?') key at any time.

Partitioning your secondary hard disk divides it into a number of partitions
(or "parts").  Each partition can be used for a different operating system.

To use a partition of the secondary hard disk for the UNIX System, it must 
be "Active" and at least 40 MBs.

WARNING:  If you delete any partition(s), all files in the deleted partitions
will be destroyed.
