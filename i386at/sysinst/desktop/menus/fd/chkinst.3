WARNING:  Files have been detected in the active partition(s) of your
hard disk(s).

You have the option of selecting a destructive installation at this
point.  You should only choose a destructive installation if you don't
want to save any files in your active partition.

If you elect to attempt a non-destructive installation, your hard disk(s)
will be checked further to determine if a non-destructive installation
is possible.

If you are restarting an interrupted installation, you should choose
non-destructive installation.

# a form or a menu.
.form
Attempt a non-destructive installation.
Perform a destructive installation.  This will destroy all files.

# This is the prompt string for a MENU only.
.selection
Type '1' or '2' followed by 'ENTER':

# This is the text for beneath the menu (used to be -i strings)  Now we

# Help text.  This can also be done using I/O redirection; if aline begins
# with a <, the rest of the line is considered to be a filename and is
# read in as though it were part of the file.  If the file contains other
# .keywords, or `backticks` or <redirection, these will not be processed.

For detailed instructions, press the 'F1' (or '?') key at any time.

UNIX System files have been detected in the active partition(s) of
your hard disk(s) - possibly from an earlier version of the UNIX System.
A destructive installation will destroy all files in the active partition(s)
of your hard disk(s).  You should only choose a destructive installation
if the active partition(s) of your hard disk(s) do not contain any
files that you wish to save.  If you elect to attempt a non-destructive
installation, your hard disk(s) will be checked further to determine
if a non-destructive installation is possible.  If a non-destructive
installation is impossible, you will be given the choice of canceling
the installation; changing the partition(s) on your hard disk(s); or
changing the active partition(s) of your hard disk(s).

If you have previously started to install the UNIX System and interrupted
that installation, you can restart it by choosing to do a non-destructive
installation.  When you reach the Package Selection screen, you can
choose to not install the packages that you have already successfully
installed by setting the install field to "No".
