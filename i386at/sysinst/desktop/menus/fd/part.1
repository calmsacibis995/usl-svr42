In order to install the UNIX System, you must reserve a partition (a portion
of your hard disk's space) on your primary hard disk for the UNIX System.
After you press 'ENTER', you will be shown a screen that will allow you to
create new partitions, delete existing partitions or change the active
partition of your primary hard disk (the partition that your computer will
boot from).

WARNING:  All files in any partition(s) you delete will be destroyed.
If you wish to attempt to preserve any files from an existing UNIX System, do
not delete its partition(s).

`if [ "${SIZE_WARN}" = "No" ] ; then echo "The UNIX System partition that you intend to use on the primary \c"; fi`
`if [ "${SIZE_WARN}" = "No" ] ; then echo "hard disk must be at least 60 MBs, and labeled \"Active.\" \c"; fi`
`if [ "${SIZE_WARN}" = "Yes" ] ; then echo "The current partitioning is unacceptable for one of the following reasons: \c"; fi`
`[ "${SIZE_WARN}" = "Yes" ] && echo " "`
`if [ "${SIZE_WARN}" = "Yes" ] ; then echo "  o  There is no UNIX System partition \c"; fi`
`if [ "${SIZE_WARN}" = "Yes" ] ; then echo "  o  The UNIX System partition is not \"active\" \c"; fi`
`if [ "${SIZE_WARN}" = "Yes" ] ; then echo "  o  The UNIX System partition is less than 60 MBs \c"; fi`

For detailed instructions, press the 'F1' (or '?') key at any time.

Partitioning your primary hard disk divides it into a number of partitions
(or "parts").  Each partition can be used for a different operating system.
One partition on your hard will be labeled "Active".  Although you may
change which partition is marked as "Active", the computer will always
boot from whichever one is active when the computer is turned on.

The UNIX System is always installed on the partition that is labeled
Active, which must be at least 60 MBs.  This partition cannot be a DOS
partition.  If you have an existing UNIX System, and you would like to
attempt to preserve the files on the disk, then make its partition Active
but do not otherwise change it.

If you are planning to create a DOS partition, it is recommended that the
DOS partition be partition 1, and that it start at the first available
cylinder on the primary hard disk (usually numbered as cylinder zero).

WARNING:  If you delete any partition(s), all files in the deleted 
partition(s) will be destroyed.
