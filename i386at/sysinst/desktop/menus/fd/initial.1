              Welcome to the UNIX System installation process!


If you have never installed the UNIX System before, it is recommended that
you press the 'F1' (or '?') key now to learn more about the installation
process and the hardware requirements of the UNIX System.


   - Pressing the 'F1' (or '?') key at any time during installation will
     display more information or help.

   - Pressing the 'Del' key at any time cancels the installation.

    SAVING FILES
    INSTALLATION OVERVIEW
    HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

SAVING FILES

The UNIX System software must be installed (or copied) onto the hard disk of
your computer.  This process may erase or alter any files on your hard disk.
Therefore, before installation, you should make a copy of any files on the
hard disk.  If you need to save files on the hard disk you should cancel the
installation now and backup your files.
information.

INSTALLATION OVERVIEW

The installation program prepares your computer's hardware and copies the
UNIX System software onto your computer's hard disk(s).  Briefly, this
involves partitioning your hard disk(s), selecting file systems,
transferring the UNIX System files to your hard disk(s).  More information
on each of these terms and steps is given below.

Partitioning a hard disk divides it into a number of parts called
"partitions".  Each partition can be used for a different operating system.
When the first or "primary" hard disk has multiple partitions, the partition
labeled as "Active" is used to boot your computer.  During installation the
UNIX System software will be copied to the Active partition of your primary
hard disk.

A file system is a collection of files and folders (also called directories)
and the structure that organizes them.  The UNIX System uses a
hierarchical (multi-level) folder structure that permits folders to contain
files and folders, which themselves can contain files and folders, and so
on.  More information on UNIX file systems can be found in the Installation
Guide.

HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

The general hardware requirements for installing the UNIX System are:

   - You must have at least a 60 MB primary hard disk (for a computer with
     more than one hard disk, the primary hard disk is the one that the
     computer boots from).

   - If you wish to create multiple partitions on your primary hard disk,
     then at least one of them must be 60 MB or larger and made Active.

If you wish to install the Foundation Set from a non-SCSI cartridge tape,
you should refer to the documentation to make sure that the configuration
of your tape drive is correct.

For additional hardware requirements, see the Installation Guide.
