The UNIX System needs  to know the current date and time as well
as your local timezone.  This form displays the current date and time
to which your computer's clock is set.  On this form, you must provide
information in the following fields:

YEAR

This field accepts a 2-digit number representing the current year,
such as 93.  At the beginning of a new century, this number should
be 00.

MONTH OF THE YEAR

This field accepts a number from 1 to 12, where 1 is January and 12
is December.

DAY OF THE MONTH

This field accepts the day, from 1 to 31, in the current month.

HOUR OF THE DAY

This field accepts the hour, from 0 to 23, in the current day.
AM and PM are not recognized, so use 24-hour format.  For example,
if it is 6:00 PM, enter 18.

MINUTE OF THE HOUR

This field accepts the minute, from 0 to 59, in the current hour.

TIMEZONE

This field allows you to select a value for your timezone.  If you
do not see your timezone listed in the choices, select "Another
timezone", and you can enter your specific timezone information on
the next screen.

When you have finished filling out this form, move the cursor to "Apply"
and then press 'ENTER' to continue.
