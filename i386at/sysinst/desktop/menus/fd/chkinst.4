You must choose an installation type.  If you choose automatic installation,
you will only be asked questions that the installation process cannot
answer on its own.  If you choose custom installation, you will be
asked additional questions that allow you to tailor your UNIX System
to meet your individual needs.  This requires knowledge of the UNIX
System.

Press the 'F1' or '?' key to see more information about these different
installation types.

AUTOMATIC INSTALLATION

If you choose an automatic installation, the UNIX System will make
assumptions about your computer and how you want your software to be
set up.  If these assumptions do not match your computer and/or how
you want your software set up, you will either have to change your
computer to match these assumptions or choose a custom installation.

AUTOMATIC INSTALLATION ASSUMPTIONS

You must have at least a 60MB primary hard disk (or active partition) to
install the UNIX System.

If you wish to install from a non-SCSI cartridge tape, you must ensure
that your cartridge tape controller is set to use Interrupt Vector
5, I/O Address 0x300 - 0x301 and DMA Channel 1 (for information on
how to verify that your cartridge tape controller is setup properly,
refer to the manual that came with your cartridge tape controller).

You must select either an existing partition (a part of the hard disk) 
or create a new partition on your primary hard disk to install the UNIX 
System in.  WARNING:  deleting an existing partition will destroy all 
files in the partition.

During automatic installation, file systems will be created on your
hard disk(s) based on the sizes of your hard disk(s), and will be created
as VERITAS File Systems (also known as VxFS file systems).  The VxFS
file system type supports fast file system access and long file name
lengths.  The software that is installed on your computer will also
use a set of assumptions.  These assumptions are discussed in the 
Installation Guide.

CUSTOM INSTALLATION

If you choose a custom installation you will have complete flexibility to
tailor the UNIX System to match your computer and software needs.  However,
custom installation requires that you supply more information to the
installation program than for an automatic installation.

CUSTOM INSTALLATION QUESTIONS

If you select a custom installation you will need to partition your hard
disk(s), select the file systems that you wish to install on your hard
disk(s), their sizes, which hard disk they will be assigned to and their
types.  The software that is installed on your computer will also ask you
questions and these are discussed in the Installation Guide.

EFFECTS ON NON-DESTRUCTIVE INSTALLATION

If it is possible for you to perform a non-destructive installation, some
things work slightly differently:

   o No new file systems will be created; the installation program will
     use the existing file systems.

   o In an automatic non-destructive installation, the program will always
     attempt to merge changes you have made to system files in your existing
     UNIX System into the new UNIX System.

   o If you choose a custom non-destructive installation, you will be given
     the option not to attempt to merge system files in this manner.

For further information, see the the Installation Guide.
