This form allows you to provide customized information about your timezone.
Enter information in the following fields:

TIMEZONE

This field accepts a 3-letter timezone abbreviation, such as "EST".  The 3
letters must all be upper case.

HOURS WEST OF GMT

Enter the number of hours west of UTC (Universal Coordinated Time), or GMT
(Greenwich Mean Time) that your timezone is.  Enter a negative number for
hours east of GMT.  For example US Eastern Standard time is five hours
west of UTC, so the correct entry for someone in this timezone would be 5.

DAYLIGHT SAVINGS CODE

This field accepts a 3-letter timezone abbreviation, such as "EDT".
If you enter text in this field, the 3 letters must all be upper case.
Leave this field blank to indicate that your timezone does not use Daylight
Savings Time.

When you have finished filling out this form, move the cursor to "Apply"
and then press 'ENTER' to continue.
