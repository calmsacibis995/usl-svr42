primary hard disk.  Your primary hard disk has only `echo ${HD_SZ}` MB
of formatted space available.

Installation will continue, but you may not be able to install all
packages of the Foundation Set.  This is the only warning that you
will receive.

See the Installation Guide for information on the space requirements
of the packages in the Foundation Set.

For detailed instructions, press the 'F1' (or '?') key at any time.

The UNIX System requires a minimum of 60 MB of formatted space on the
primary hard disk to fit all packages of the Foundation Set, and only
`echo ${HD_SZ}` MB of space is available on your primary hard disk.

You may not be able to install all the packages in the Foundation Set,
therefore, and should use the information in the Installation Guide
on package space requirements to help you select the packages in
the Foundation Set to install.

This is the only warning that you will receive.  

Pressing 'ENTER' will continue the installation.  When you are
later prompted to select packages in the Foundation Set to install,
keep in mind that only those packages that are absolutely necessary
for your system should be selected.
