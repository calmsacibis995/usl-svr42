WARNING:  A possibly damaged `echo $os_str` System is installed.  

An existing UNIX System has been detected on your hard disk. However,
some of the existing files may be damaged.  The full extent of corruption
is not known at this time.  If you continue with a non-destructive
installation process some of your files may not be preserved.

If you wish to try to save these files you should cancel this installation
and attempt to back them up. Installation should then be restarted from
the beginning.
.form
Cancel the installation and shut down your computer.
Continue with non-destructive installation.

For detailed instructions, press the 'F1' (or '?') key at any time.

When the active partition(s) of your hard disk(s) was examined, a UNIX 
System was detected.  However, the disk has been damaged such that some 
files may not be preserved during installation.  If you continue with a 
non-destructive UNIX System installation it may not be successful due to 
the unknown extent of the damage.

Before you continue with the installation, it is recommended that you
attempt to perform a system backup since files in the active partition(s)
of your hard disk(s) may be destroyed.  However, due to the state of the 
hard disk, a backup may not be successful.

For more information see the Installation Guide.
