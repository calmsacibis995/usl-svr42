Interrupted Installation

The primary hard disk contains a partially installation UNIX System.  You may
choose to resume this previous installation at the point it was interrupted.
However, any choices you made during the previous installation will still be
in effect during any resumed installation.

Otherwise, you should shut down the computer and either change the active
partition and boot another operating system or begin a new installation by
booting from the disk labeled "Boot Floppy 1 of 3".  See the
Installation Guide for more details.
