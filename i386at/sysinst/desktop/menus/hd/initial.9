Possible Files Detected

When the active partition of your primary hard disk was examined,
potential files were found.  If you continue with UNIX System
installation all files in the active partition of your primary hard
disk will be destroyed.  If you wish to preserve these files you should
cancel the installation, boot the operating system that is currently
installed on the active partition of your primary hard disk and use the
data archiving or backup tools appropriate for that operating system to
preserve your files.  If you choose to begin a new installation, all
files in the active partition(s) of your hard disk(s) will be
destroyed.  Alternatively, you may cancel the installation and change
the active partition of your primary hard disk (and/or the active
partition of your secondary hard disk - if you have one) to another
partition on the hard disk(s) (if one is available).  For more details
see the Installation Guide.
