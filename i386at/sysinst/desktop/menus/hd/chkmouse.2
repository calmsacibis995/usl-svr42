SERIAL PORT

In order for the UNIX System to properly handle your serial mouse, it must
know the serial port that you have the mouse attached to.  Refer to the
documentation that came with your computer to determine if your serial mouse
is attached to tty00 (also known as COM1) or tty01 (also known as COM2).

NUMBER OF MOUSE BUTTONS

When you use your mouse in the UNIX System's graphical user environment, you
will be able to use different buttons on the mouse for activities such as
drag-and-drop, double-clicking, and popping up menus.  Your mouse has either
two or three buttons; please select the correct number.

See the Installation Guide for more details.
