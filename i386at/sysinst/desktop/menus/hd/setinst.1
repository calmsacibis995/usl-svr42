When the active partition of your primary hard disk was examined, a
UNIX System was detected which can't be preserved during installation.
A new installation will destroy all files in the active partition(s)
of your hard disk(s).  If you wish to preserve these files you should
cancel the installation, boot the operating system that is currently
installed on the active partition of your primary hard disk and use
the file archiving or backup tools appropriate for that operating system
to save your files.  Alternatively, you may cancel the installation
and change the active partition of your primary hard disk (and/or the
active partition of your secondary hard disk - if you have one) to
another partition on the hard disk(s) (if one is available).  For more
details see the the Installation Guide.
