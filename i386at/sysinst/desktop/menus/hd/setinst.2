For detailed instructions, press the 'F1' (or '?') key at any time.

In order to preserve your files during installation, a certain amount of 
free disk space must be available on your disk.  Your disk currently does
not have enough.  If you want to save your files during installation, you
will need to free some additional space.  You can do this by removing files 
that you no longer need, or by removing applications that you can easily 
reinstall or no longer use.

If you are unable to free enough disk space, you should back up all your 
files before continuing the installation.
