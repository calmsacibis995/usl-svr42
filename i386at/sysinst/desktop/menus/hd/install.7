Software for the UNIX System is packaged in sets. Installation of the
Foundation Set is required.  This software is shipped to you either on a
second group of diskettes (different from the boot diskettes) or on a
cartridge tape.  

Select the drive you will be using to install the Foundation Set.
.optstring
Your choices are:
.form
`[ "${NF1}" = "1" ] && echo "Diskette Drive 1 \c"`
`[ "${NF2}" = "1" ] && echo "Diskette Drive 2 \c"`
`[ "${NC1}" = "1" ] && echo "Cartridge Tape Drive \c"`
#The format of this menu file is key to its working with the
#installation script hdscripts/install.sh.
#
#format for this menu file:
#
#:N<tag>:<text>
#
#where <tag> can be one of: F1, F2, C1 -- the text can change, but
#the tag must remain the same.
#
.selection
Press a number between 1 and `echo $MEDIA_CNT` followed by 'ENTER'.
.help
For detailed instructions, press the 'F1' (or '?') key at any time.

The Installation Process needs to know where to look for the software
that is to be installed.

DISKETTE DRIVE OPTION

If you received only diskettes with your UNIX System software package, 
either 5-1/4" or 3-1/2", you should select a diskette drive option.  
If you have only one diskette drive, it is usually named Drive 1.  If you
have more than one diskette drive, the drive you use to boot the computer is 
Drive 1.  A second drive, that is not used to boot the computer, is usually 
named Drive 2.

If you have previously used the computer for a DOS operating system, Drive 1
would correspond to a DOS "disk A:"; Drive 2 to a DOS "disk B:".

CARTRIDGE TAPES

If you received a cartridge tape with your UNIX System software package, 
you should select the "Cartridge Tape" option.  If you have only one tape 
drive, it is usually named Drive 1.
