For detailed instructions, press the 'F1' (or '?') key at any time.

The UNIX System Foundation Set installation is complete.  The computer is
about to shut itself down so that it may begin using the programs and
files that you have installed.  Please make certain that the boot drive
is empty so that the computer will read the programs from the hard disk.

After the computer reboots, you will have the opportunity to set up and
try out your mouse, or you can select not to install a mouse.  If you
want to use a mouse, make sure that it is attached to your computer before
you restart it.

After either setting up your mouse or choosing not to use one, you will
be asked to create a user account for your UNIX System.  Once you've
created the account, you will be able to begin using your UNIX System.
