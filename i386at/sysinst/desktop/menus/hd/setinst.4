You must choose an installation type.  If you choose automatic installation,
the UNIX System will make as many of the installation decisions as possible.
You will only be asked questions that the UNIX System cannot answer on its
own.  If you choose custom installation, you will be asked many more questions
than an automatic installation, but you will be able to tailor your UNIX
System to meet your individual needs.

For further instructions on using this help facility and on using the UNIX
System installation program, press the 'F1' key (or the '?' key) at any
time while you are reading help.

If you need more information than is available through this help facility,
refer to the Installation Guide.

This help screen will provide you with information on the following topics:

    AUTOMATIC INSTALLATION
    AUTOMATIC INSTALLATION ASSUMPTIONS
    CUSTOM INSTALLATION
    CUSTOM INSTALLATION QUESTIONS

AUTOMATIC INSTALLATION

If you choose an automatic installation, the UNIX System will make
assumptions about your computer and how you want your software to be set
up.  If these assumptions do not match your computer and/or how you want
your software set up (see below), you will either have to change your
computer to match these assumptions or choose a custom installation (for
more details, see below, or see the Installation Guide).

AUTOMATIC INSTALLATION ASSUMPTIONS

You must have at least a 60MB primary hard disk (or active partition) to
install the UNIX System.

If you wish to install from a non-SCSI cartridge tape, you must ensure that
your cartridge tape controller is set to use Interrupt Vector 5, I/O Address
0x300 - 0x301 and DMA Channel 1 (for information on how to verify that your
cartridge tape controller is setup properly, refer to the manual that came
with your cartridge tape controller).

You must select either an existing partition (a portion of the hard disk) or
create a new partition on your primary hard disk to install the UNIX System in.
Note:  deleting an existing partition will destroy all files in the partition.

File systems will be created on your hard disk(s) based on the sizes of
your hard disk(s), and will be created as Veritas File Systems (also known
as vxfs file systems).  The vxfs file system type supports fast file
system access and long file name lengths.  The software that is installed
on your computer will also use a set of assumptions and these assumptions
are discussed in the Installation Guide.

CUSTOM INSTALLATION

If you choose a custom installation you will have complete flexibility to
tailor the UNIX System to match your computer and software needs.  However,
custom installation requires that you supply more information to the
installation program than for an automatic installation.  For more
information on the types of questions you will be asked during a custom
installation, see below.

CUSTOM INSTALLATION QUESTIONS

If you select a custom installation you will need to partition your hard
disk(s), select the file systems that you wish to install on your hard
disk(s), their sizes, which hard disk they will be assigned to and their
types.  The software that is installed on your computer will also ask you
questions and these are discussed in the Installation Guide.

For further information, see the Installation Guide.
