Interrupted Installation

When the active partition of your primary hard disk was examined, a
partially installed UNIX System was detected.  If you continue with a new
UNIX System installation this partially installed UNIX System will be
destroyed.  You may choose to resume the previous installation at the
point it was interrupted (thereby saving some time).  Any choices you made
during the previous installation will still be in effect during this
resumed installation.

For example, if you had previously selected a custom installation, you can
not resume the previous installation as an automatic installation.  If you
choose to begin a new installation, all data in the active partition(s) of
your hard disk(s) will be destroyed.  Alternately, you may cancel the
installation and change the active partition of your primary hard disk
(and/or the active partition of your secondary hard disk - if you have one)
to another partition on the hard disk(s) (if one is available).
