An error occurred while trying to install the Foundation Set.  This
screen offers you the chance to try the installation again by pressing
'ENTER'.

The failure may have occurred because the wrong diskette or cartridge
tape was inserted.  Another possibility is that the diskette or cartridge
tape is not correctly inserted in the computer.

If the retry of the Foundation Set installation fails as well, please
see the Installation Guide for more details.
