WARNING:  A UNIX System is already installed.

You have the option of overlaying your existing UNIX System. An overlay
installation will only overwrite system files ( leaving your personal data
intact).

It is also strongly recommended that you perform a system backup before
proceeding with an overlay installation.


Do you wish to perform a non-overlay installation and destroy all data in
the active partition of your hard disk?
.form
Resume the previous installation.
Begin a new installation.  This will destroy all files.

Overlay Installation

When the active partition of your hard disk was examined, a UNIX System
was detected.  If you continue with a new UNIX System installation this
existing UNIX System will be destroyed.  You may choose to overlay the
existing UNIX System without destroying your personal data.  However,
it is strongly recommended that you perform a system backup before
performing an overlay installation.  Also, certain system files should
also be backed up as these will be overwritten during the overlay
process.  Alternatively, you may cancel the installation and change the
active partition to another partition on the hard disk (if one is
available).  For more details see the Installation Guide.
