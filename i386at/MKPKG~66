# THIS SCRIPT AND THE TOOLS THEY CREATE SHOULD ONLY BE USED
# IF YOU ARE BUILDING SVR4.2 ON A SVR4.0 VERSION 4 SYSTEM.
#
#
# If you are building on a SVR4.2 system, the native pkgmk
# & pkgtrans can be used. They can be found in the softint pkg
# which is in the softdev set.
#
#
# This script will build the SVR4.0 Version 4 executable of the
# SVR4.2 pkgmk & pkgtrans commands.
#
# pkgmk is needed for compression.
# pkgtrans is needed because of sets.
#
#
#
# After this script completes, pkgmk & pkgtrans can be
# found, respectively, in the following directories:
#
# $ROOT/usr/src/$WORK/cmd/pkgtools/oampkg/pkgmk
# $ROOT/usr/src/$WORK/cmd/pkgtools/oampkg/pkgtrans
#
