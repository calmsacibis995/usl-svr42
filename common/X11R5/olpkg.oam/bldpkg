# Packaging script for DESTiny foundation set graphics packages

# Assume current dir is "olpkg.oam"
# with subdirectories pkg.dtolrun, pkg.dtxt, pkg.desktop adm and consem.
#
# this script will setup $XDIR, per the source generation instructions,
# build the consem drives and create the pkg spool directory. bldmedia
# script will then transfer the package to tape or floppy.

# WARNING! this is intermediate between the old graphics manual building
# of packages and an integrated DESTiny package setup, which will need to
# do the consem build.  For P6 (only), two versions of the desktop metaphor
# package exist, one with and one without consem.  bldpkg does its usual
# thing, and packages the version with that, pkg.dtmcons.  To avoid the
# complications of this, use pkg.desktop instead (thereby omitting consem).
