This demo program (unit_test1) provides an exclusives widget, 
child of the Athena Box widget.  The exclusives widget has a series of 
rectangular button widgets with callbacks to test different XtSetValues 
resources on the fly and demonstrate some of its capabilities:

The initial display demonstrates that all buttons in an exclusives
widget are of constant height and width and that only one button
can be set at any one time, the background must that of the parent,
and the border must be zero.

	Suicide:	demonstrates that the exclusives widget
			self-destructs cleanly.

	Transpose:	will transpose from horizontal to
			vertical or vice versa.  This is a prototype
			for changing the XtNcolumns, a resource of
			the exclusives widget.

	More of Me:	will create an additional button in the 
			exclusives widget.  This demonstrates 
			that the exclusives widget will grow either
			horizontally or vertically to accomodate
			a new button.

	Poof:		will cause the button to self-destruct,
			demonstrating the exclusives widget's
			shrinking in respose to a deleted (and
			eventually, unmanaged) child button.

	Tiny:		will substitute a longer string in the button,
			demonstrating that the exclusives widget will
			grow all buttons wider in response to one
			button growing longer than the rest.
