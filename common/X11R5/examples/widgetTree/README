The widgetTree client is a sample MooLIT program that uses
every widget, gadget, and flattened widget in the toolkit.
The base window displays the Widget hierarchy of MoOLIT.
The buttons in the Widget hierarchy will invoke a sample
of a particular WidgetClass.  The Help key (typically F1)
will display the C source code that generates the example.

Try running widgetTree in both OPEN LOOK and Motif modes.
In Motif mode, some of the widgets will be insensitive
because they do not have a Motif look and feel available.

To make the Makefile using the Imakefile do:

imake -DUseInstalled -DTOPDIR=/usr/X -DCURDIR=. -I../../config
