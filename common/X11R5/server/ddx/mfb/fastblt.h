/*
 * Fast bitblt macros for certain hardware.  If your machine has an addressing
 * mode of small constant + register, you'll probably want this magic specific
 * code.  It's 25% faster for the R2000.  I haven't studied the Sparc
 * instruction set, but I suspect it also has this addressing mode.  Also,
 * unrolling the loop by 32 is possibly excessive for mfb. The number of times
 * the loop is actually looped through is pretty small.
 */

/*
 * WARNING:  These macros make *a lot* of assumptions about
 * the environment they are invoked in.  Plenty of implicit
 * arguments, lots of side effects.  Don't use them casually.
