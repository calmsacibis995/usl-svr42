Here's some things that would be nice:

1. Noise lovers can put noises in (please allow the user to turn them on
   and off both from resources and the command line).

2. The score file stuff is a mess.  Some nice person could fix it to be
   simply one 10-line asciiTextWidget with a "Done" button.  There might
   be bugs in this code, because I don't use it.  Feel free to rewrite.

3. The user can configure the size of the boxes in the resource file.  
   However, s/he must add a new bitmap for the box, if the size changes.
   Instead, the pixmap for the boxes should be constructed in the program.

Xtetris is a very nice example (in my ever-so-humble opinion) of an X
application, which uses most of Xt and Xaw to their full advantage.  I
rewrote it primarily to learn the ins-and-outs of Xaw.

If you're interested in hacking around with X11, this is a good one
to play with.  Why?

1. Almost every possible parameter has been moved into the resource
   defaults file.

2. Special efforts have been made to keep this code tight.

3. There are some interesting things left to fix (see above).

Hope to be getting your patches.
