% History: Spider is a solitaire card game that can be found in various books
% of same; the rules are presumed to be in the public domain.  The author's
% first computer implementation was on the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab
% system (SAIL).  It was later ported to the Xerox Development Environment.
% The card images are loosely based on scanned-in images but were largely
% redrawn by the author with help from Larry Rosenberg.
%
% This program is written entirely in NeWS and runs on OPEN WINDOWS 1.0.
% It could be made to run much faster if parts of it were written in C, using
% NeWS mainly for its display and input capabilities, but that is left as an
% exercise for the reader.  Spider may also run with little or no modification
% on subsequent releases of OPEN WINDOWS, but no guarantee is made on this
% point (nor any other; see above!).  To run Spider, feed this file to 'psh'.
