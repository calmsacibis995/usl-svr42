.SH DESCRIPTION
.I spider
is a particularly challenging double-deck solitaire.  Unlike most
solitaires, it provides extraordinary opportunities for the skillful player
to overcome bad luck in the deal by means of careful analysis and complex
manipulations.  The
.I spider
program does not actually play the game for you,
but rather takes the place of the cards (by displaying the tableau on the
screen) and keeping a record of the game so that you can follow out long
lines of play without losing track of where you started from.
.LP
.I spider
when compiled with XView has a property sheet for defining resources.
The property sheet is on the "File" menu item.  To be sure spot help is
active, set the environment variable HELPDIR to the directory containing
the spider.info file.
