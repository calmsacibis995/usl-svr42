User Setup

Before anyone can use your computer, they must have an account on your
system. Use the User Setup window to to assign (and remove) user
accounts and to change the permissions assigned to those accounts,
thereby controlling the types of tasks a user can perform.

The User Setup window also lets you change the properties of accounts
(whether or not the account has permission to modify or shutdown the
system or whether or not someone is a Desktop user) and enables you to
manage \d(groups^group) to which users belong. You must have owner permissions
to add, delete, and change user accounts and group accounts, and to
change user permissions.

The following windows are provided for User Setup:

        \k(User Setup Window)
        \k(User Setup: Account Permissions Window)
        \k(User Setup: User Account Properties Window)

     user is removed.

     Note: If the Backup User's Files option is selected, a
     confirmation notice appears before the user's files are removed.
     The notice enables you to change you mind about deleting the
     user's files.

     files before they are removed. If you want to backup the user's
     files, click on the box on this line.

     and the user's files. If the Backup User's Files options is

     for backing up the user's files.

   o No Button: This button closes the User Setup: Confirmation window
     without deleting the user.

   o Help Button: This button provides on-line help for the User
     Setup: Confirmation window.

Caution: You should not delete reserved accounts or pre-existing
groups. Deleting a reserved account could prohibit you from performing
certain tasks on your system. Deleting pre-existing groups could cause
permission problems when some users attempt to read or access certain
files.

2. User Setup: Account Permissions Window

Use the User Setup: Account Permissions window to change the permis-
sions for a user account. A user's permissions determine what that
user can do on your system. For example, to change permissions for a
user, you must be designated as the owner of the system.

The User Setup: Account Permissions window displays a list of account
permissions, each with check box. If you click on the first check box
(Selected User is the System Owner), all other check boxes are filled
in. This would give the selected user permissions to make any neces-
sary changes to the system.

To make a user the System Owner, you must have System Owner Account
permission. Initially, the account created during installation is the
System Owner. If you want to give another account System Owner Account
permissions, log in using the System Owner account and change the
permissions for the other account.

The following permission can be changed from this window:

   o Shutdown System 

   o Access Disks, Tapes, etc.

   o Access Remote Systems

   o Change Dialup Setup

   o Change Internet Setup

   o Administer Printers

   o Add/Remove Fonts

   o Add/Remove Applications

   o Advertise Local Folders/Files

   o Connect to Remote Folders/Files

Additional permissions may be available depending upon what additional
software is installed on your system.

3. User Setup: User Account Properties Window

Use the User Setup: User Account Properties window to display the
current properties for the icon selected in the User Setup window. You
can change the following properties (if you have appropriate
permission):

   o The Login ID is what the user enters at the login ID prompt. All
     the files and folders that the user owns are identified with this
     ID.

   o The Comment is usually the full name of the user, but can contain
     any text you choose.

   o Type refers to whether or not a Desktop environment is created
     for a user. If a user is a Nondesktop user, they can only
     execute programs from the character based UNIX System prompt.

   o GUI specifies whether the Desktop is presented with an OPEN LOOK
     or a Motif graphical user interface (GUI).

If you click on the Extra Options box, a window with the following
properties appears.

   o The Home Folder is the folder where the user stores their files
     and folders. For example, for a user called zorb, the Home Folder
     might be /home/zorb.

   o X-terminal Name is the name of the system where the Desktop is
     displayed when you don't log in from the console. For example,
     if you use an X-terminal for logging in, enter the system name of
     the X-terminal. You can also include the display number, such as
     :0 or :1. If you don't include the display number, :0 is
     assumed.

   o The Shell is the UNIX System shell that is used when the Desktop
     is not used. Two shells are /usr/bin/sh and /usr/bin/ksh.

   o User ID: User ID is a unique number assigned to each account. It
     is used internally by UNIX SVR4.2 to manage files, processes, and
     so on, that are used by users.

   o The Select Group From box lists available groups. Each user must
     belong to a group. Select a group from the list. Use the
     scrollbar, if present, to view additional groups.
