Following are brief descriptions of each property setting.

The "Default pathname" field is filename supplied to the 3 popup \
command windows (Open, Save As, Print File). This field cannot \
be blank.

The "Print command" field is for setting your favorite lp command \
line (e.g., "lp -dprinter2 -opostscript -oPages4"). Refer to the \
lp man page and to your local System Administrator for valid lp options. \
This field cannot be blank.

All of the following fields are used to set xpr options; they cannot be blank.

The "Output format" field specifies the format mode used to print \
the window image. It is equivalent to xpr's "-d" option field. Refer to \
the xpr man page for a list of valid items.

The "Orientation" field specifies a portrait or landscape mode \
on paper for the printed image. It is equivalent respectively to \
xpr's "-p" or "-l" option. 

Setting the "Reverse video" field to "on" will cause the \
image to be printed intensity inverted. It is equivalent \
to xpr's "-r" option.

All of the following fields are used to set xpr options; they \
are optional and can be blank.

The "Header" field allows you to specify a title above \
the printed image. It is equivalent to xpr's "-h" option. 

The "Footer" field allows you to specify a title below the printed \
image. It is equivalent to xpr's "-t" option. 

The "Pages" field specifies how many pages the printed image will be \
split into. It is equivalent to xpr's "-s" option. 

The "Scale" field specifies the factor to which the printed image \
is scaled. It is equivalent to xpr's "-S" option. 

The "Left offset" field specifies the left offset from which the printed \
image will appear on paper. It is equivalent to xpr's "-L" option. 

The "Top offset" field specifies the top offset from which \
the printed image will appear on paper. It is equivalent to \
xpr's "-T" option.

The "Max width" field specifies the maximum width the image \
is scalable to. It is equivalent to xpr's "-W" option. \
It overrides the "Scale" field.

The "Max height" field specifies the maximum height the image is \
scalable to. It is equivalent to xpr's "-H" option. \
It overrides the "Scale" field.

Selecting the "Apply" button will set the properties for your current \
Print Screen session only.  All changes take effect immediately for \
this session. The window will be dismissed.

Selecting the "Set Default" button will set and save the properties for \
your current and all future Print Screen sessions.  All \
changes take effect immediately. The window will be dismissed.

Selecting the "Reset" button will reset the property \
fields to their previously saved values. This only changes the \
visual appearance of the property sheet; nothing is changed \
for this session nor for future sessions (you still have to \
select Apply or Set Defaults to do that).

Selecting the "Reset To Factory" button will reset the property \
fields to their default system values. This only changes the \
visual appearance of the property sheet; nothing is changed \
for this session nor for future sessions (you still \
have to select Apply or Set Defaults to do that).

For more information on above settings, refer to the man pages for xpr and lp.

When you select one of the print functions, xpr \
and lp will be executed, with options specified from the saved settings \
of your most recent "Apply" or "Set Defaults" invocation. \
Any subsequent errors will appear in the file $HOME/.oliniterr, and \
any messages from xpr and lp will appear in the \
file $HOME/.olinitout.
