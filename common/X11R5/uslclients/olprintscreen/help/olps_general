The Print Screen application gives you a menu selection with \
the ability to display, capture, and print all or portions of \
a window or screen. This application combines the features of \
the X Window System commands xwd, xwud, xpr, together with \
the UNIX System command lp. 

To capture an image (i.e., window, area of screen, or entire screen) \
onto the canvas of Print Screen, select the "Window", "Area", \
or "Screen" item from the "Capture Image" menu button. The \
application will disappear momentarily to allow you \
to capture the desired image.

Once the image is captured onto Print Screen's canvas, \
you can save it via the "Save As" item from the "File" menu \
button. To read in a previously saved file, select the "Open" item \
from the same "File" menu button. 

To print the canvas contents of Print Screen, select \
the "Print Contents" item from the "Print" menu button. To \
print an already saved file, select the "Print File" item from \
the same "Print" menu button.

To capture an image and direct it \
automatically to a printer without displaying it on \
Print Screen's canvas, select \
the "Window", "Area", or "Screen" item from the "Print" menu \
button.

To change the properties for the default filename, the image formatting \
settings (i.e., xpr command options), and printing settings \
(i.e., lp command line), select the "Properties" item.

For more detailed information, please refer to the User's \
Guide Chapter on the Print Screen application, as well as the \
User's Guide Appendix A man pages for xwd, xwud, and xpr.
