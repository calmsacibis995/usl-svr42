Use the Miscellaneous property window to control various interactions \
with the OPEN LOOK GUI.

Beep:    governs when the system should sound the bell.

Window Layering:    specifies how separate windows of the same \
application should be managed.

Start OPEN LOOK GUI at login:    controls automatic \
startup of OPEN LOOK upon login (provided that your account \
has been set up with the oladduser command).

SELECT Mouse Press:    specifies the action the SELECT \
mouse button will have when pressed on menu buttons. \
"Displays Menu" means that SELECT will behave just like MENU \
does for menu buttons, whereas "Displays Default" provides additional \
functionality for rapid access to the submenu's default item.

Help Model:    specifies whether a help message (like this one) \
applies to the control or text area that is currently highlighted \
("Input Focus"), or to the control or text area under the mouse \
pointer.

Set Input Area:    specifies whether you give input focus to a window by \
clicking SELECT on the window or moving the mouse into the window.

Interface Appearance:    selects either a flat, ``2D'' visual \
presentation of the OPEN LOOK GUI, or a richer ``3D'' visual. \
If you are currently using a black and white monitor, the 3D \
look isn't very effective, and you may want to stick to 2D.

Mnemonics:    specifies whether mnemonics are available, \
and (if available) how they are shown.

Accelerators:    specifies whether accelerators are available, \
and (if available) how they are shown.

Click SELECT on the box(es) of your choice to change \
the property sheet settings.

Click SELECT on the Apply (or Apply All) button to save all changes \
made to all property sheets.  \
The Reset button can be used to reset the property sheet settings \
to reflect the currently saved values.  \
The Reset To Factory button can be used to reset \
the property sheet settings to the factory defaults.  \
Note that Reset and Reset to Factory do not affect the saved \
property values; \
the saved values are changed only when Apply is SELECTed.  \
Also, Reset and Reset to Factory only reset the properties on \
the current property sheet.

The property window is automatically dismissed if not pinned \
when Apply is chosen.

Applied changes go into effect immediately, and are reflected \
in all OPEN LOOK applications, including those already launched.
