Use the Keyboard Settings property window to customize \
the key mappings used for the core OPEN LOOK keyboard functions.  \
To change the modifier for a function, \
move the pointer into the square menu button next to that function, \
press MENU, drag the pointer to the modifier you want, and release MENU.  \
If you decide not to choose a new modifier, \
move the pointer off the menu and release the mouse button.  \
To change the primary key for a function, click SELECT \
in the text field corresponding to that function and modify \
the text to reflect the new key.  \
Valid primary function keys are "a"-"z", "F1"-"F12", "Tab", or "Esc", \
where the modifier for "a"-"z" must be Ctrl or Alt.

Click SELECT on the Apply button to save all changes \
made to the property window settings.  \
The Reset button can be used to reset the property window settings \
to reflect the currently saved values.  \
The Reset To Factory button can be used to reset \
the property window settings to the factory defaults.  \
Note that Reset and Reset To Factory do not affect the saved property values; \
the saved values are changed only when Apply is SELECTed.  \
The property window is automatically dismissed if not pinned \
when Apply is chosen.

Applied changes go into effect immediately, and are reflected \
in new OPEN LOOK applications that you run.  Applications that are \
already running may not use all of the new key settings.
