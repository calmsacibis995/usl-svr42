Use the Mouse Settings property window to customize the \
mouse button mappings used for the core OPEN LOOK mouse functions.

To change the modifier for a function, move the pointer into the \
square menu button next to that function, press MENU, \
drag the pointer to the modifier you want, and release MENU.  \
If you decide not to choose a new modifier, \
move the pointer off the menu and release the mouse button.  \
You can select more than one modifier.

To change the mouse button used for SELECT, ADJUST, or MENU, \
click SELECT on the box(es) of your choice; \
L, M, and R mean left, middle, and right mouse buttons, respectively.

Click SELECT on the Apply (or Apply All) button to save all changes \
made to all property sheets.  \
The Reset button can be used to reset the property sheet settings \
to reflect the currently saved values.  \
The Reset To Factory button can be used to reset \
the property sheet settings to the factory defaults.  \
Note that Reset and Reset to Factory do not affect the saved \
property values; \
the saved values are changed only when Apply is SELECTed.  \
Also, Reset and Reset to Factory only reset the properties on \
the current property sheet.

The property window is automatically dismissed if not pinned \
when Apply is chosen.

Applied changes go into effect immediately, and are reflected \
in all OPEN LOOK applications, including those already launched.
