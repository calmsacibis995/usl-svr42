The workspace is the whole screen.  \
Windows and icons are displayed on the workspace.  \
Windows are application work areas.  \
Icons are windows that are displayed in a compressed form \
to keep them readily available yet out of the way.

 Using the Mouse
You use the mouse pointer to control windows and icons \
and to choose activities from menus.  \
You use the mouse by moving the pointer to a specific place on the screen \
and then pressing or clicking a mouse button to perform an action.  \
You can perform the following actions with the mouse:

Press a mouse button down and hold it.

Release a mouse button to initiate the action.

Click a mouse button by pressing and releasing it without moving the pointer.

Double-click a mouse button by clicking twice within a short time period.

Move the pointer by sliding the mouse with no buttons pressed.

Drag the pointer by sliding the mouse with one or more buttons pressed.

To maintain consistency, \
each mouse button is assigned a specific function.  \
The three basic mouse functions are:

SELECT to select objects or manipulate controls

ADJUST to add or take away from a group of selected objects

MENU to display and choose from menus.

 Starting Applications
You start applications by moving the pointer anywhere on the background \
of the workspace and press or click MENU to display the Workspace menu.

 Using Menus
Each point on the screen has a menu associated with it.  \
The menu that is displayed depends on the position of the pointer.  \
You can view and choose from any OPEN LOOK UI menu \
in two ways using the MENU mouse button:

Press-Drag-Release

Click-Move-Click

To use press-drag release, press MENU.  \
The menu appropriate for the pointer location is displayed.  \
Drag the pointer from control to control.  \
When the pointer is on a control, \
you will see visual feedback for the control.  \
When the pointer is on the control you want, release MENU.  \
The control is executed and the menu is dismissed.  \
If you do not want to choose a control, \
move the pointer off the menu and release the mouse button.

To use click-move-click, click MENU.  \
The menu appropriate for the pointer location \
is displayed and stays on the screen.  \
You do not need to keep the MENU button pressed.  \
Move the pointer to the control you want to choose.  \
Click SELECT or MENU to choose the control.  \
The control is executed and the menu is dismissed.  \
If you do not want to choose a control, \
move the pointer off the menu and click SELECT or MENU \
to dismiss the menu without choosing a control.

 Moving Windows and Icons
You can move windows and icons on the workspace individually.  \
To move a window or icon, press SELECT and drag the pointer.  \
A bounding box is displayed showing the outline of the window or icon.  \
When the bounding box is at the place where you want \
to move the window or icon, release SELECT.
