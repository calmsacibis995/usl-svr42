The Workspace Properties window gives you access to several \
elements of the OPEN LOOK environment that you can adjust to fit \
your needs and customs.

You choose a category of elements to peruse and perhaps change, \
by picking from the workspace menu, or by picking from the \
CATEGORY menu you see in the window. Both menus have the same \
choices, although the workspace menu is organized a differently \
to make it a little easier to get to some of the choices.

If you are using the ``SELECT Displays Default'' feature of the \
mouse, you can click SELECT on the CATEGORY button to step through \
each of the property categories or ``property sheets''.

Each property sheet has a set of controls, or type-in fields, \
or pictures, that you can change to customize the interface.

As you make changes in the property sheets, ``diff-marks'' \
or change bars will appear on the left side of the sheet to show \
you where you have made changes so far. \
If you move to another property sheet and you have changes on the \
previous sheet, \
the CATEGORY button will display a change bar as a clue that there \
are more changes pending than what you see in front of you. \
As an additional clue, the ``Apply'' button at the bottom of the \
window changes to ``Apply All'' (as in ``apply all changes'').
