Use the Keyboard Scrolling Functions property sheet to bind keys to \
document or picture manipulation.

To change a binding, click SELECT over the current binding \
(or move the focus highlight with the TAB key to the current binding), \
then press the backslash (\) key and immediately press the key \
you want to bind to the operation. You can include ``modifers'' \
such as Shift, Alt, and Control (or Ctrl) in the binding.

Usually an operation needs only a single binding. \
However, some operations (Default Action is a good example) may \
need two bindings. An Alternate Key Sequence (or binding) is \
needed whenever the Primary Key Sequence would be misinterpreted \
or ``consumed'' as a different operation. The Return key, for example, \
is often bound to the Default Action operation, but it is also used \
to end each line of a multi-line document or file. \
Because you may wish to invoke the ``default action'' while typing \
in a document, you may find it useful having an alternate key for \
Default Action.

Click SELECT on the Apply (or Apply All) button to save all changes \
made to all property sheets.  \
The Reset button can be used to reset the property sheet settings \
to reflect the currently saved values.  \
The Reset To Factory button can be used to reset \
the property sheet settings to the factory defaults.  \
Note that Reset and Reset to Factory do not affect the saved \
property values; \
the saved values are changed only when Apply is SELECTed.  \
Also, Reset and Reset to Factory only reset the properties on \
the current property sheet.

The property window is automatically dismissed if not pinned \
when Apply is chosen.

Applied changes go into effect immediately, and are reflected \
in all OPEN LOOK applications, including those already launched.
