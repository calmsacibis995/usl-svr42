You use the Workspace menu to open new application windows, \
to access utilities such as refreshing the screen, \
to set global workspace properties, and to exit from the workspace.

You can view and choose from menus in three ways using the MENU mouse button:

Press-Drag-Release

Click-Move-Click

Pinning up the Workspace menu

 Using Press-Drag-Release
To use press-drag release, \
move the pointer to the workspace, \
press MENU, drag the pointer to the control you want, and release MENU.  \
To see the menus under the Programs or Utilities menu buttons, \
drag the pointer onto the right half of the menu button.  \
When the pointer is on the control you want, release MENU.  \
The control is executed and the menu is dismissed.  \
If you do not want to choose a control, \
move the pointer off the menu and release the mouse button.

 Using Click-Move-Click
To use click-move-click, move the pointer to the workspace and click MENU.  \
The Workspace menu is displayed and stays on the screen.  \
Move the pointer to the control you want and click SELECT or MENU.  \
The control is executed and the menu is dismissed.  \
If you do not want to choose a control, \
move the pointer off the menu and click SELECT or MENU \
to dismiss the menu without choosing a control.

 Using the Pushpin
To pin up the Workspace menu, \
press MENU and drag the pointer to the pushpin.  \
When the pin pops into the hole, release MENU.  \
The Workspace menu becomes a pop-up window, \
and you choose from it in the same way you use controls \
in the control area of a window:  \
click SELECT to use a button or execute the default choice \
from the submenu under a menu button, or move the pointer to a \
menu button and press MENU to display its submenu.

 Changing the Default Setting
Each menu in a menu group has a default setting, \
which is shown by a default ring.  \
You can change the default setting for any menu using the steps below:

1. Press the default modifier key and MENU

2. Drag the pointer from control to control.  \
The default ring follows the pointer.

3. When the default ring is on the control you want to use as the default, \
release MENU and then release the modifier key.

If you release the modifier key first and then release MENU, \
in addition to setting the default, the command is executed.
