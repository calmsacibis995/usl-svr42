You can pin up frequently-used menus \
(when they have a pushpin) for continued access.  \
To do this, press MENU and drag the pointer to the pushpin.  \
When the pin pops into the hole, release MENU.

The pinned menu turns into a pop-up window, \
and you use the controls in the same way you use controls in a control area:

Press SELECT on a button to execute a command.

Press SELECT on a menu button to execute \
the default from the button's submenu.

Press MENU on a menu button to display the button's submenu, \
drag the pointer to the button you want to choose, and release MENU.
