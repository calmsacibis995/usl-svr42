Use the Icons property sheet to control the location and appearance \
of your iconized windows.

Location:   specifies the default area of the workspace where icons \
will be "parked".

Border:   controls the visibility of a frame border around your icons \
on color displays.

Click SELECT on the box(es) of your choice \
to change the property sheet settings.

Click SELECT on the Apply (or Apply All) button to save all changes \
made to all property sheets.  \
The Reset button can be used to reset the property sheet settings \
to reflect the currently saved values.  \
The Reset To Factory button can be used to reset \
the property sheet settings to the factory defaults.  \
Note that Reset and Reset to Factory do not affect the saved \
property values; \
the saved values are changed only when Apply is SELECTed.  \
Also, Reset and Reset to Factory only reset the properties on \
the current property sheet.

The property window is automatically dismissed if not pinned \
when Apply is chosen.

Applied changes go into effect immediately, and are reflected \
in all OPEN LOOK applications, including those already launched.
