Use the Color property sheet to customize the colors \
used for different OPEN LOOK GUI elements.

    For limited color and grayscale displays:
In the Color Sample area, \
click the SELECT mouse button over the element you want to change. \
Then, in the color palette across the top of the property sheet, \
click SELECT over the color you want to give to the sample element. \
You can also click SELECT over one of the named elements \
in the 6-item list to the left. This is another way to select an \
element to color, instead of clicking in the Color Sample. \
You can also click ADJUST in the 6-item list to select more than \
one element to color simultaneously. (ADJUST doesn't work in the \
Color Sample.)

    For full color and grayscale displays:
Select a Color Sample element the same as above, but choose a color \
by moving the slider(s) at the top of the property sheet. For grayscale \
displays the single slider adjusts the shade of gray from black to \
white. For color displays, the sliders adjust the amounts of Red, Green, \
and Blue in the final color.

    For black and white displays:
The possibilities are more limited; \
click SELECT on the box of your choice to get either \
``white on black'' or ``black on white'' windows.

Click SELECT on the Apply (or Apply All) button to save all changes \
made to all property sheets.  \
The Reset button can be used to reset the property sheet settings \
to reflect the currently saved values.  \
The Reset To Factory button can be used to reset \
the property sheet settings to the factory defaults.  \
Note that Reset and Reset to Factory do not affect the saved \
property values; \
the saved values are changed only when Apply is SELECTed.  \
Also, Reset and Reset to Factory only reset the properties on \
the current property sheet.

The property window is automatically dismissed if not pinned \
when Apply is chosen.

Applied changes go into effect immediately, and are reflected \
in all OPEN LOOK applications, including those already launched.
