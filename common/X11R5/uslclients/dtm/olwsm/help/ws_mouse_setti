Mouse Damping Factor:
	The number of pixels you can move the pointer before a drag is \
initiated.  In other words, pressing and releasing a mouse button \
before moving the pointer by this amount results in the press/release \
combination being interpreted as a single logical mouse CLICK.

Multi-Click Timeout:
	Time interval used to group successive mouse clicks as a single \
logical action.  For example, if two mouse clicks occur within this time \
interval and the pointer motion does not exceed the Mouse Damping Factor, \
the mouse click pair is interpreted as a double-click.

Drag Right Distance:
	If a MenuButton is in a "Press-Drag-Release" menu and the pointer \
is dragged this many pixels to the right, the MenuButton's \
submenu will be displayed.  Note: drag-right distance does not apply to \
MenuButtons that are in "Click-Move-Click" menus or to MenuButtons that \
are not in menus.

Menu Mark Region:
	Each MenuButton has an active region associated with it that displays \
the submenu regardless whether you drag the pointer to the right.  This region \
is located at the extreme right of a MenuButton and its extent (in pixels) \
is determined by this setting.
	The Menu Mark Region setting also is used to dismiss menus.  For \
example, if a menu cascade is in "Press-Drag-Release" mode and the pointer is \
dragged in and then out the left side of the last menu in the cascade, \
the last menu is dismissed if the pointer continues to the left by \
the amount of the this setting.

Click SELECT on the Apply (or Apply All) button to save all changes \
made to all property sheets.  \
The Reset button can be used to reset the property sheet settings \
to reflect the currently saved values.  \
The Reset To Factory button can be used to reset \
the property sheet settings to the factory defaults.  \
Note that Reset and Reset to Factory do not affect the saved \
property values; \
the saved values are changed only when Apply is SELECTed.  \
Also, Reset and Reset to Factory only reset the properties on \
the current property sheet.

The property window is automatically dismissed if not pinned \
when Apply is chosen.

Applied changes go into effect immediately, and are reflected \
in all OPEN LOOK applications, including those already launched.
