Use the Programs Submenu property sheet to customize \
the applications available on the Programs submenu \
of the Workspace menu.

Associated with each application in the submenu \
are three fields of information.

Name:    specifies how the application will be identified in
the submenu.

Invocation String:    gives the command line that starts the application \
from a UNIX System shell.

Mnemonic:    specifies an (optional) single letter that you can \
use to launch the application from the Programs Submenu.

Think of the scrolling list in this property window \
as a repository for this information, where the application \
whose information you are currently working on has a boxed name.  \
To change the application that you are working on, \
click SELECT on the name for the new one.  \
The scrollbar may be used to access applications \
that have scrolled out of view.

To edit the information for an application already in the submenu, \
first SELECT the entry for that application in the scrolling list.  \
This will bring up the current data for that entry in the \
two text fields below.  \
Then click SELECT in the text field(s) \
you want to change (or move between them using \
the Next and Previous Field keys), \
and modify the text to reflect the new information.  \
When you are finished with your changes, \
click SELECT on the Apply Edits button to update the property window settings.

To delete an application from the submenu, \
SELECT the entry for that application in the scrolling list, \
then click SELECT on the Delete button.  \
The application will be removed from the scrolling list.

To insert a new application into the submenu before \
or after the currently SELECTed one, \
press MENU on the Insert button, drag the pointer \
to Before or After as desired, and release MENU.  \
A new, blank entry will appear in the scrolling list \
in the appropriate place (either before or after) \
and becomes the application that you are working on.  \
Continue then with the procedure for editing an application's information \
(see above) to fill in the empty text fields.  \
If you decide not to add this entry after all, \
you can simply click SELECT on the Delete button to remove it from the list.

Click SELECT on the Apply (or Apply All) button to save all changes \
made to all property sheets.  \
The Reset button can be used to reset the property sheet settings \
to reflect the currently saved values.  \
The Reset To Factory button can be used to reset \
the property sheet settings to the factory defaults.  \
Note that Reset and Reset to Factory do not affect the saved \
property values; \
the saved values are changed only when Apply is SELECTed.  \
Also, Reset and Reset to Factory only reset the properties on \
the current property sheet.

The property window is automatically dismissed if not pinned \
when Apply is chosen.

Applied changes go into effect immediately, and are reflected \
in all OPEN LOOK applications, including those already launched.
