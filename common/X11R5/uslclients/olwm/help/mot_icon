An icon is a small window containing a glyph representing an application
that has been Minimized.  To restore an application in iconic state, move
the pointer onto the icon and click SELECT to display the Window menu,
and choose Restore by moving the pointer above the Restore menu item
and clicking SELECT.

To move an icon, move the pointer onto the icon, press SELECT, drag the
pointer to a new location, and release SELECT. The icon will snap to the
nearest allowable position (grid) on the screen. Icons may not be moved
off the screen, nor may they.
