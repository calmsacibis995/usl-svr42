When the "power user" option is on (i.e., selectDoesPreview is True),
click SELECT on the Window menu button to activate the default item
from the Window menu without displaying the menu. For example, when
Close is the default item on the Window menu, moving the pointer to
the Window menu button and clicking SELECT closes the window to
an icon.

When the "power user" option is off (i.e., selectDoesPreview is False),
click SELECT on the Window menu button to display the Window menu
in Stayup mode, or press SELECT on the Window menu button to display
the Window menu in Press-Drag-Release mode.
