Restore

	Use the Restore item to return the dimensions of the window
	at the pointer location to the default window size. The
	Restore button can be used for windows that have been
	minimized (iconified) or maximized.

From iconic (minimized) state:

	When an application is started up as an icon, the first time
	you restore it the application base window is displayed in a
	location specified by the application. Subsequently, each time
	you open an icon it is displayed in the same location and state
	that it had when you iconified it.

From maximized state:

	When a window is restored from the maximized state, the window
	is resized to the dimensions that it had prior to being maximized.
