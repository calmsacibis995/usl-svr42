The window border thickens to show that you have selected the window.

Select a window for the following reasons:

	To set the input area to that window, a process that activates an
	inactive caret and brings the window to the front of the screen

	To move it by dragging with SELECT, to select a window, move
	the pointer onto the window background (header, footer, or
	border edge without a scrollbar) and click SELECT.
