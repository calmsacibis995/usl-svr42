Use the OK button stack menu to apply properties that you have changed
to the selection:

	Apply - To apply the settings to the selection.

	Reset - To reset the settings for the properties window to
		the values for the original selection.

These choices are also available on the Settings menu that you access
from the properties window pane by pressing MENU. Drag the pointer to
a button and release MENU. When the properties window is not pinned
up, the properties window is dismissed after the changes are applied.
