Use the Restore Size item to return the dimensions of the window at
the pointer location to the default window size.

The Restore Size command does not return windows to an iconic state.
Drag MENU onto the item and release MENU to restore the size of the
window at the pointer location to the default size. You can use the
Restore Size command without displaying the Window menu by moving
the pointer onto the window background and double-clicking SELECT.
