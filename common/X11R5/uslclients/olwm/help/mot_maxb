Maximize:

	Use the Maximize button to expand the dimensions of the
	window or icon at the pointer location to a larger format
	(specified by the application).

To Maximize, click SELECT:

	Move the mouse pointer onto the maximize button and click
	SELECT to increase the size of the window to the maximum
	size allowed by the application, or to size of the screen.
	The window will expand in size, and the maximize button
	will invert to indicate that the state of the window is
	"maximized". To restore a maximized window, click SELECT
