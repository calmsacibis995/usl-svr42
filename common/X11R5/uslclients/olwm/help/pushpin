Use the pushpin to pin up a pop-up window for continued access.

Move the pointer to an unpinned pushpin and click SELECT to push the
pin in the hole. Click SELECT on a pinned pushpin to pop it out of
the hole and dismiss the pop-up window.

When the pop-up window is displayed in an unpinned state, the pop-up
window is automatically dismissed the next time you click SELECT on an
action button in that window. If you want to dismiss the window without
issuing a command, click SELECT on the pushpin to pin the window, and
then click SELECT to dismiss the window.
