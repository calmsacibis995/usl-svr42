Use the resize corners to expand or contract the area of a window in either
the horizontal dimension, the vertical dimension, or both.

Move the mouse pointer to any resize corner. If the resizeCursors resource
is set, then the cursor will change to indicate that it is in position to
resize. While the cursor is in the resize corner, press SELECT, and drag
the pointer. A bounding box is displayed to show you the location of the
new window border. If the resize feedback option is set, then a feedback
window is displayed in the center of the screen with the new size of the
window, should you release SELECT now.

Release SELECT when the window is at the desired size. The window is
redisplayed in the new size, and the contents adjust to fit within the
borders of the window. If the resize feedback option is set, the feedback
window disappears.
