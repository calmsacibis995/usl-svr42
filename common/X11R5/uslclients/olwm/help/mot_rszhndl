Use the resize handles to expand or contract the area of a window in
either the horizontal dimension (for the left and right resize handles)
or the vertical dimension (for the top and bottom resize handles).

Move the mouse pointer to the area within a resize handle. If the
resizeCursors resource is set, then the cursor will change to indicate
that it is in position to resize. While the cursor is in the resize
handle, press SELECT, and drag the pointer. A bounding box is displayed
to show you the location of the new window border. If the resize feedback
option is set, then a feedback window is displayed in the center of the
screen with the new size of the window, should you release SELECT now.

Release SELECT when the window is at the desired size. The window is
redisplayed in the new size, and the contents adjust to fit within the
borders of the window. If the resize feedback option is set, the feedback
window disappears.
