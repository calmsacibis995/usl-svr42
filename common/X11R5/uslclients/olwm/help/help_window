The Help window for each application displays help for the object under
the pointer. To see more help text for the same application without
dismissing the Help window, move the pointer to another object in the
same application and press the HELP key again. The view in the
magnifying glass changes, and appropriate help text is displayed in
the pane of the same Help window.

If you move the pointer to a different application window and press the
HELP key without dismissing the original Help window, a second Help
window is displayed.

You dismiss a Help window by moving the pointer to the pushpin and
clicking SELECT. Alternatively, you can move the pointer to the header
of the Help window, press MENU, move the pointer onto the Dismiss
item, and release MENU.

Magnifying glass:

     The view in the magnifying glass shows the object at the pointer
     position when you pressed the HELP key.  To change the view in
     the magnifying glass and display help text in the pane for the
     new object, move the pointer to another object in the same
     application and press the HELP key again.
