Use the resize corners to expand or contract the area of a window.

Move the pointer to any resize corner, press SELECT, and drag the pointer.
The resize corner highlights and a bounding box is displayed to show you
the location of the new window border.  Release SELECT. The window is
redisplayed in the new size, and the contents adjust to fit within the
borders of the window.
