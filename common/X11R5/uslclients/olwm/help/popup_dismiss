When you remove pop-up windows from the workspace, they do not close
to an icon. The label on the top button of the pop-up window menu is
Dismiss to show this distinction.

The Dismiss submenu has two choices:

		This Window
		All Pop-ups

When you use This Window, the pop-up window is dismissed. When you
use All Pop-ups, all of the pop-up windows for the application are
dismissed.  You can choose the default setting from the Dismiss
submenu without displaying it by dragging MENU onto the Dismiss
button stack and releasing MENU.

To display the Dismiss submenu, drag MENU into the right half of the
button stack. To choose a button from the Dismiss submenu, drag MENU
onto a button and release MENU.

When the pop-up window is not pinned up, it is dismissed after the
command is successfully completed.
