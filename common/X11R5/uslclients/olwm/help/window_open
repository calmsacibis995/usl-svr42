Use the Open button to open the icon at the pointer location.

When an application is started up as an icon, the first time you open
it the application base window is displayed in a location specified by
the application. Subsequently, each time you open an icon it is displayed
in the same location and state that it had when you closed it to an icon.

You can open an icon without displaying the Window menu by moving the
pointer onto the icon and double-clicking SELECT.
