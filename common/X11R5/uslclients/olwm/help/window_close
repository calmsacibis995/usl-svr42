Close:

	Use the Close item to change the visual representation of
	the base window at the pointer location to an icon. When
	an application base window is closed, its associated
	pop-up windows are also closed whether or not the pop-up
	windows are selected. Drag MENU onto the item and release
	MENU to close the window.

Open:

	Use the Open button to open an icon at the pointer location.
	When an application is started up as an icon, the first time
	you open it the application base window is displayed in a
	location specified by the application. Subsequently, each time
	you open an icon it is displayed in the same location and state
	that it had when you closed it to an icon. You can open an icon
	without displaying the Window menu by moving the pointer onto
	the icon and double-clicking SELECT.
