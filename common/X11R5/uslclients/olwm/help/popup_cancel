When you have made changes to a properties window but have not
applied those changes, the label on the top button stack of the
pop-up window menu is Cancel to show you that the changes to the
properties window will be discarded when you dismiss it. The Cancel
submenu has two choices:

		This Window
		All Pop-ups

When you use This Window, the properties window is dismissed.
When you use All Pop-ups, the properties window, and the rest of
the pop-up windows for the application are dismissed. You can choose
the default setting from the Cancel submenu without displaying it by
dragging MENU onto the Cancel button stack and releasing MENU. To
display the Cancel submenu, drag MENU into the right half of the
button stack.  To choose a button from the Cancel submenu, drag MENU
onto a button and release MENU. When the pop-up window is not pinned
up, it is dismissed after the command is successfully completed.
