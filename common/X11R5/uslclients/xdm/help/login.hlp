Login

The Login window provides access (and security) to the UNIX system.
All users must have a login ID in order to log in. Each login ID is
protected with a password. Without the correct password, you cannot
enter the system.

The following window is provided for Login:

        \k(Login Window)

1. Login Window

The Login window has two text boxes. Use the first to enter your login
ID. Use the second to enter your password. Notice that when you enter
your password, it does not display on the screen. This is to protect
it from being seen by others nearby when you log in.

When the Login window appears, enter your login ID and press Enter.
Enter your password and either press Enter or click on the Login but-
ton. If you made an error entering either your login ID or password, a
message appears at the bottom of the window indicating that the login
attempt failed. Both text boxes are then cleared and you can try
again.

Once you enter your login ID and password correctly, one of the fol-
lowing occurs:

   o If you are set up as a Desktop user and you have set "Start
     Desktop at Login" to "Yes" in the Desktop Preferences window, the
     UNIX Desktop appears.

   o If you are setup as a Desktop user and you have set "Start
     Desktop at Login" to "No" in the Desktop Preferences window, the
     Do Not Start Desktop At Login window appears.

   o If you are not set up as a Desktop user, this is indicated by a
     notice window which appears.

     This notice window has three buttons: Exit, Cancel, and Help.

     - Exit Button: This button lets you exit from the notice window.
       The Console Login prompt appears. You can now log into the
       system through the Console Login prompt to get to a character-
       based UNIX system prompt.

     - Cancel Button: This button returns you to the Login window.

     - Help Button: This button provides on-line help for the
       notice window.
