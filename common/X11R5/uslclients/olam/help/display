By entering a display name, host name, and network type in the Display \
Name, Host Name, and Netspec fields respectively, OPEN LOOK clients on \
this machine will be permitted to connect to the specified display on \
the specified remote host using the specified network type.
Valid network types depend on the networking software that has been \
installed.  "starlan" and "it" are the most common, representing \
STARLAN and TCP/IP respectively.  Contact your system administrator to \
find out what networking software has been installed.

An entry with a "*" for both the Display Name and Host Name fields \
matches all display specifications.  This directs all connection \
requests to use the specified network type.  There should usually be \
at most one entry of this type at the end of the list.

Entries are tried in order until a successful connection is made, an \
entry with "*" for both the Display Name and Host Name is tried, or \
the end of the list is reached.

Example:
An entry containing "my6386-s", "my6386", and "starlan", would allow \
you to connect to the machine called "my6386" over the STARLAN network \
by using "my6386-s:0.0" as the display specification.

Example:
An entry containing "*", "*", and "it", would allow you to connect to \
any machine over the TCP/IP network by using "<machine-name>:0.0" as \
the display specification (Provided <machine-name> does not match a \
preceding Display Name entry that produces a successful connection.).
