This is the directory containing the source for the Desktop UNIX(r) System
clock client.  This client provides a simple clock with alarm capability.
The clock can run in either analog or digital mode and chimes based on
user perference.  The alarm is implemented using the cron(1).  Two shells
help implement this feature:

     alarm.sh: shell that is run to trigger the alarm

  cronedit.sh: shell that edits the crontab

The client doesn't need a pixmap since it draws the current time in the
icon window when the clock is iconized.

Features that don't yet exist:

   Help is not implemented.

   The prompt dialog for the alarm doesn't
   retrieve the current setting.

   Ships bell's is still in the clock, but may
   be pulled out based on feedback in the beta.

The clock doesn't support drag-and-drop (since it doesn't make sense).
