ABSTRACT: Backup Service
	The "extended" backup menu allows you to manage the backup
	side of the extended backup and restore service.  This
	feature is intended for medium to large systems where
	administrative backup and restore tasks are generally
	advanced.

	Functions are provided to determine the backup rotation period,
	to specify how backups are to be done for file systems and data
	partitions, to display the backup history and backup status
	logs, to establish lists of files that should not be backed up,
	to respond to operator prompts from backup jobs and to schedule
	backups and the reminder messages that backups should be done.

	The extended backup and restore interface is not part of the
	trusted computing base (TCB).  The secure backup service is
	suggested for trusted environments.
