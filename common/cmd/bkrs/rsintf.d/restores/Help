ABSTRACT: Restore Service
	The subcommands in this menu manage the "restore" side of the
	extended backup and restore service.  The functions provided
	allow you to request restores of files, directories,
	partitions or file systems, to display the status of pending
	restore requests and to manage operator interactions with
	restore requests.

	The extended backup and restore interface is not part of the
	trusted computing base (TCB).  The secure backup service is
	suggested for trusted systems.
