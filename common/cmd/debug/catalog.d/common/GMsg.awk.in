#ident	"@(#)debugger:catalog.d/common/GMsg.awk.in	1.12"

# This file is the input to GMsg.awk, the awk script that creates gui_msg.h,
# GMcatalog, and GMtable.c.

# gui_msg.h
#	defines the enum Gui_msg_id, that lists the types of message used
#	by the graphical user interface

# GMtable.c
#	contains the initialization code for the message table

# GMcatalog
#	contains the format strings, one per line, and is the input
#	to mkmsgs to create a message database.

# ------ WARNING -------
# Messages in an existing catalog cannot be modified or removed,
# because we have no control over the translated catalogs,
# also, calls to gettxt have hard-coded numbers in them.
# Messages MUST stay in the same order - after the first release
# the catalog probably should not be machine generated

# The format of each non-comment line in this file is:
# msg_id	format_string
# 
# Messages may span multiple lines.
# Unlike the awk script for the debug engine's messages,
# GMsg.awk assumes all messages should be translated and
# should appear in the catalog.  (Some of debug's messages
# are only relevant to the user interface and produce no output,
# all of the messages here are for human consumption).
