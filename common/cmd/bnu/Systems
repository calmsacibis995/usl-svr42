#		using a Hayes modem.

#		to connect to the "cu" service through the "listen"
#		service. The corresponding "CS - - - CS" entry
#		should be entered in the Devices file.
#
#		sysname Any CS - -,listen:cu
#
# 	Example 3:
#		This entry should be used for "uucico" going over
#		the TCP network.  It causes the Connection Server
#		to connect to the "10103" service through the "listen" 
#		service. The "10103" service invokes uucico. The 
#		corresponding "CS - - - CS" entry should be entered 
#		in the Devices file.
