ABSTRACT:
	This task removes software packages from the system or
	spooled on a device.

pkgloc:Software Location
	Enter the word "installed" to indicate that you want to
	remove software which is currently installed on your system.
	To remove software which is spooled, enter the device on
	which the software resides (e.g., "diskette1" or "9track1".)
	To indicate the default spool directory, enter "spool".

pkgid:Package Selection
	If you wish to remove a specific package, enter the package
	instance identifier (e.g., "spell" or "rfs").  You may enter
	multiple package identifiers by separating each one with a
	comma (e.g., "spell,rfs,windowing".) To remove all instances of
	a particular package, use a wildcard format (e.g. "dbase.*").

	WARNING:  Do NOT remove package associated with the operation
	of sysadm from within sysadm.  These include 'fmli', 'lp' and
	'oam'.  If you want to remove these packages, it is HIGHLY
	recommended that you use the 'pkgrm' command from outside of
	sysadm.  If you wish to remove all packages (which includes the
	packages necessary for sysadm to work) you can enter 'pkgrm all'
	from the shell command line.  'All' is NOT a valid choice for a
	package under remove.

dftfile:Name of Admin File to be Used
	Enter the name of an installation administration file to be
	used instead of the default admin file.

	The software removal task checks for errors during execution.
	When a problem occurs, the task checks the admin file for
	instructions on how to proceed.  The file defines values for
	eleven parameters, each supplying a resolution to a potential
	problem.

	The system provides a default admin file name "default".  If
	you want to assign different values for your default
	parameters, you can create and use multiple admin files.
