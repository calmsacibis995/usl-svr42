For some packages in this set, you need to choose what type of installation
you would prefer.  There are two options.

AUTOMATIC INSTALLATION

If you choose an automatic installation, the UNIX System will make
assumptions about your computer and how you want the software package
to be set up.

CUSTOM INSTALLATION

If you choose a custom installation you will have complete flexibility to
tailor a package to match your computer and software needs.  However,
custom installation requires that you supply more information to the
installation program than for an automatic installation.
