# This file controls the mapping of UNIX 
# devices to MS-DOS drive letters and types. 
#
#	These are fine for a 6386 WGS Running SVR3.2:
#
#		A=/dev/rdsk/f0t
#		B=/dev/rdsk/f1t
#	Remember that only MS-DOS files may have colons in them.
#
#	Only one colon per MS-DOS filename.
#
#	MS-DOS filenames are either:
#
#		[ABCD...]:filename
#
#			or
#
#		DEVICE:filename
#
#	Where DEVICE is any UNIX file capable of seeking.
#	This means you can use regular unix files for MS-DOS
#	filesystems. Just say FILE: and all is well.
#
#
# Floppy device names
A=/dev/rdsk/f0t
B=/dev/rdsk/f1t
X=/dev/rdsk/f0t
Y=/dev/rdsk/f1t
#
# MS-DOS partition of hard disk 0.
# If an application expects C: to be the MS-DOS partition of hard disk 0,
# then uncomment the C line and comment the D line below.
#C=/dev/rdsk/0s5
D=/dev/rdsk/0s5
#
# MS-DOS partition of hard disk 1.
# If an application expects D: to be the MS-DOS partition of hard disk 1,
# then uncomment the following line.
#D=/dev/rdsk/1s5
