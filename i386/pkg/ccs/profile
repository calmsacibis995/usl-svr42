# During installation, it appends a line which will make

# During removal, it removes the line it added before.
#
# To use this, there should be a line like
#
# 	e build /etc/profile ? ? ?
#
# in the package prototype file.
#
# PKGINST should be provided by the installation service.
# CORESIDENT set by request script.
