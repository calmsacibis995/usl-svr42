Press CHOICES to display the days of the week. You may select one
day, a combination of days, or "any" days of the week.

You can indicate a series of days by typing the first day
and last day separated by a "-".  For example,  M - Th would schedule
the backup for Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.
