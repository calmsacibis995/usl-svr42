Foundation Set (fnd)

The Foundation Set contains those packages that are usually installed
on every system.  Other packages that may be installed later will frequently
require that those packages found in the Foundation Set are already
installed.

The following packages are part of the Foundation Set:

BASE SYSTEM (base)

The Base System package contains the basic UNIX System.  It must be
installed on all systems.

As this package is installed, you will be asked to enter a name to
identify your UNIX System.

PRINTER SUPPORT (lp)

The Printer Support package has the programs and support files needed for
adding and using a large number of printers.

During a custom installation of the printer support package, you will
be asked which printers you require support for.  If the Operations,
Administration, and Maintenance package is already installed you will
be given the option of installing the administration interface to this
package.

NETWORK SUPPORT UTILITIES (nsu)

The Network Support Utilities package contains several files and programs
that are used by your UNIX System to communicate with smart terminals
and other computers.  Other networking packages that you may wish
to install will require that this package has been installed first.

During a custom installation of this package you will be asked for
the number of remote terminals that will be accessing your computer
through a network.  In addition, if the Operations, Administration,
and Maintenance package is already installed you will be given the
option of installing the Network Support Utilities interface to this
package.

ENHANCED APPLICATION COMPATIBILITY (acp)

The Enhanced Application Compatibility package contains programs and
files that may be needed if you will be using packages or programs
designed for earlier versions of the UNIX System.

GRAPHICS UTILITIES (dtxt)

The Graphics Utilities package contains the programs and files that support
the UNIX Desktop graphical user interface.

ADOBE TYPE MANAGER (atm)

The Adobe Type Manager package contains files and utilities to help the
UNIX System manage a large number of fonts, or typefaces.

DESKTOP MANAGER (desktop)

Building on the Graphics Utilities, the Desktop Manager package is the
UNIX Desktop graphical user interface itself.  Both these packages must be
installed for the Desktop Manager to function.

The Manager includes programs such as the Waste-Basket, On-Line Help, Clock,
and Calculator, among others.  A graphical administrative interface is also
included that makes managing your UNIX System easier.
