We make 2 versions of libsocket: libsockhost.so uses /etc/hosts for
gethostbyname() and gethostbyaddr; libsockdns.so uses domain name service.
By default, the former is installed as /usr/lib/libsocket.so.
If you run DNS, copy libsockdns.so into /usr/lib/libsocket.so.

This code (inet, resolver and socket) also is in the nametoaddr
"resolv.so" library (/usr/src/lib/nametoaddr/resolv) -- any changes
here should be reflected there.

libresolv.a now resides in libsocket/resolver, rather than in its own dir.
